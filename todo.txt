3 buttons (?): 
				/\		A : UP button.
				--
				
				
				(o)		C : menu btn.   <--- If this btn is long-pressed we'll enter in the menu and sub-menus.
				
				
				--
				\/		B : DOWN button.  <---  A short pression of A or B will cause the display to backlight







TODO list:  (XXX -> done)

******************* 1 *******************
	===== Data acquisition =====
	
XXX	- Temperature
XXX	- Humidity	<--- Multiplexing!!
	- Percentage of power to the wheel
	
	
******************* 2 *******************
	===== USB Transfer =====	
	

******************* 3 *******************
===== Store data in external EEPROM =====
	----
		struct DAILY_Store{
			.. variables with Day, Month, Year ..
			data[]; // array containing every-X-minutes captures. --> X=10?
		}

	----
		24 hours * 60 mins = 1440 min per day --> capture every X mins => 1440/X captures per day
		144 * N (N=number of variables to capture: humidity, temp)
		Size of each variable: B Byte
		
		TOTAL per day= (1440 / X) * B * N
		
		//////example: X = 10 mins, B = 1 Byte, N = 2 vars
		//////		--> tot = 144*2 = 244 bytes per day
		example: X= 30m, B= 4 byte --> tot = 48 * 4 = ~200 byte.

	ATMega1284P: 4KB EEPROM -> 4096/244 ~= 16 days of capturing before filling the eeprom
	External EEPROM: 128K -> 131072/244 ~= 537 days  --> VERY GOOD
	External EEprom: 512K -> 524288/200 ~= 2621 days --> even better ;)
	NO 1024K (at24c1024) because it requires a different addressing method (8 bit instead of 7)

******************* 4 *******************
XXX	===== Backlight control =====
	
		If menu is entered or menu key is pressed, the display
		will backlight for 10 or 20 secs.  (state=x ???)
	

******************* 5 *******************
	===== Zone control / Zone division editing =====
	
		Depending upon the time zone, the mcu will drive the motor
		at constant speed or it will adjust its speed in relation
		with the humidity and temperature of the area.
		
		An entry in the main menu will allow to modify the timezone division, Z1 and Z2.

******************* 6 *******************
	===== Motor speed control =====
		Inside the timezone regolation there will be an entry which
		allows to edit the motor speed of that zone (fixed||variable speed).
	

******************* 7 *******************
XXX	===== Date and time regolation =====

		When entered in the menu, selecting "Regola ora" or "Regola data"
		it'll be possible to change date and time.
		Starting from left to right, each entry (h, m, s || day, month, year)
		is selected at once and it can be edited using UP and DOWN buttons.
		The CENTER button pression will move the cursor to the right, or
		end the editing if the last position was at the most right.
		
		__rev: if the cursor is at most right, the pression of CENTER button will
				bring it to the first position on the left.
				If CENTER is long-pressed a confirm message will appear, and if Yes will be
				selected and another long-pression will occur, the regolation of date or time
				will take effect.
	
	***************** FIXME! ******************
	
		We shall modify it in order to act like this:
		if I enter in the Time editing menu, all I can do is to hit UP or DOWN buttons
		and that makes the time go up or down of ONE UNIT for each hit;
		if i choose 31 and the month was 02, if I move to the right the day will be
		changed to 28 (or 29 depending on leap year).
	
	
******************* 8 *******************
XXX	===== ADC MULTIPLEXING!!! =====
	
		Using one channel for the temperature and another for
		the humidity it will be necessary to multiplex the channels,
		in order to capture correctly the analog values.
